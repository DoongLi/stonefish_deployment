Requirements
============

This ROS package is accompanying the *Stonefish* library, which requires a modern multi-core processor to run the physics calculations in realtime. 

A discrete graphics card (GPU) with the support for **OpenGL 4.3 or higher** is required to run graphical simulations.

Dependencies
============

The following dependencies have to be installed prior to building the package:

* `Stonefish <https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish>`_ (C++ library)

* `cola2_msgs <https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/cola2_msgs>`_ (ROS package)

Building
========

Clone the code of the package to your catkin workspace and build as usual. No additional steps are required.
